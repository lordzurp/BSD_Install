# A note on permissions:  a user must have read and write permissions for the
# devices named here in order to access the DOS file systems.  You might give
# ALL USERS access to ALL FLOPPY DISKS via the command
#
#     chmod a+rw /dev/fd[0-9]*
#
# or you might give SPECIFIC GROUP MEMBERS access to a PARTICULAR FLOPPY DISK
# via the commands
#
#     chmod g+rw /dev/fd0 ; chgrp staff /dev/fd0
#
# (and ensure selected people are in a group such as staff).


# Floppy disks.  Here, A: and B: use automatic size detection.
#
# Example: To prepare drive A: for use as a 1.44M floppy on FreeBSD:
#   [1] low level format with ......... fdformat -f 1440 /dev/fd0
#   [2] write a file system with ...... newfs_msdos -f 1440 /dev/fd0
#   [3] then use mcopy/mdir etc. in the usual way.
#
# The mformat command could also be used to build the DOS file system
# in place of newfs_msdos.

# # FreeBSD floppy drives
drive a: file="/dev/fd0"
drive b: file="/dev/fd1"

# FreeBSD automatically detects a number of common floppy densities, like
# 720 KB and 1440 KB MS-DOS formatted media.
#
# To change the density of FreeBSD floppy devices to something unusual,
# use fdcontrol(8).
